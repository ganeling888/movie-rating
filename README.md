### Tell Users Which Movies to Watch

This contest gives you a new and larger version of the MovieLens dataset.  It includes more movies and more users, but the most recent 50% of the ratings have been removed from the version you receive to create the test dataset.

Download the data (especially the ratings file) and submit your predicted ratings.

You can start working from code you previously developed or from the python files on the data tab for this competition.  

Note that the submission data includes an id column that is in the form <user_number>_<movie_number>.

The included rec_runner.py file has a function to create the correct submission format from your ratings matrix (it also needs access to a correctly formatted submission such as the sample submission)
